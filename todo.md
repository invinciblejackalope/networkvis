Probably going to use one of these libraries:
- [D3](https://d3js.org/)
- ~~[graph-tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/static/doc/quickstart.html)~~

~~I might also have to learn how to use [React](https://reactjs.org/) for this rip~~
Actually I'm reconsidering bringing in React to make live updates nicer!

To do:
- Add functionality for links: add custom links from index, add link descriptions to pages, make a page to display a link, allow deletion of custom links
- Fix inconsistencies with Markdown (formatting and unformatting sometimes changes the original text)
  - If there are line breaks, they disappear upon focus

Goals (in order of importance):
- Display a graph &#x2713;
- Embed content in graph nodes &#x2713;
- Implement blogging functionality &#x2713;
- Nice floaty feel &#x2713;
- Different ways to construct the graph (e.g. by tags, by pub date)
- Data analytics
- Login &#x2713;
- Collaborative blogs
- Figure out how to delete nodes (mods? democracy?)
- Live updates for new nodes
- Media upload

- Interface with other websites (import posts? embed videos etc.?)
