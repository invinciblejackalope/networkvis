Probably going to use one of these libraries:
- [D3](https://d3js.org/)
- ~~[graph-tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/static/doc/quickstart.html)~~

I might also have to learn how to use [React](https://reactjs.org/) for this rip

Goals (in order of importance):
- Display a graph
- Implement blogging functionality
- Embed posts in graph nodes (maybe)
- Nice floaty feel (hopefully)
- Different ways to construct the graph (e.g. by tags, by pub date)
- Data analytics
- Login
- Collaborative blogs
- Figure out how to delete nodes (mods? democracy?)
- Live updates for new nodes
- Interface with other websites (import posts? embed videos etc.?)
