    <h1> About </h1>
    <p> <strong> NetVis Blogger </strong> is a combined blogger, mind mapper,
    and network visualizer.
    Its format is like a regular blogger - one can write as well as style posts
    - but users are able to see visually how the pages are connected, giving the
    pasttime of blogging an entirely new feel.
    In addition, users are encouraged to collaborate on blog posts, allowing
    them to build off of each other's ideas in a very visual way. </p>
  </div>
  <div class='main section padded'>
    <p> The main view of a blog looks like this: </p>
    <img src='{% static "blogger/network-vis.png "%}' />
    <p> (As of now, there is only one blog 'main', though the intention is to
    eventually allow for both personal and group-run blogs.)
    Each node represents a single post, which contains a title, a
    description, and content.
    The titles are displayed on the nodes, as shown.
    To see the node's description, click on the title text, and the node will
    expand, showing the description in the middle. </p>
  </div>
  <div class='main section padded'>
    <p> The title is not a node's only clickable item: there are also "+" and "-"
    buttons hidden on the bottom and top, respectively.
    If you mouse over them, they will appear.
    Their functions are to create a new node and delete the node, respectively.
    Upon being clicked, the node will expand to show the corresponding form for
    adding or deleting a node. </p>
  </div>
  <div class='main section padded'>
    <p> When expanding a node via its title, you will notice a link saying
    "Visit page."
    As would make sense, the link goes to the post page, displaying the title,
    the authors, the description, and the content, like this:</p>
    <img src='{% static "blogger/network-vis-2.png "%}' />
    <p style='margin-bottom: 0;'> If none of the authors is 'admin-frozen' and one of the following are true: </p>
    <div style='display: inline-block;'>
      <ul>
        <li> you are one of the authors
        <li> one of the authors is 'admin'
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p style='margin-top: 0;'> you will be able to edit the page's content.
    If the first is true, then you will also be able to give any user edit
    permission by clicking the '+' button.
    The description and the content sections support John Gruber's
    <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown'> Markdown</a>.
    The bottom row of buttons is also important: the first two set the
    background colors of the title and the description, respectively, and the
    last three do what they say.
    The "Save changes" button is highlighted because it is very important: be
    sure to save your changes before leaving the page! </p>
  </div>
  <div class='main section padded'>
    <p> Of course, nodes are nothing without links connecting them together.
    Whenever a new node is created from another node, a green link is connected
    between the two nodes.
    Also, you can create custom links via the "Add link" button on a blog's main
    view, which will be added to the two posts' pages. </p>
  </div>
  <div class='main section padded'>
    <p> Finally, there are basic user management functions, such as changing the
    display name, changing the password, and deleting the account. More user
    customization is coming soon! </p>

  <!-- determine which buttons to show based on 'helped' (a variable depending
  on where the user has been) -->
